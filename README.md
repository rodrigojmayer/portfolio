## Projects

Here are some of the exciting projects featured in my portfolio:

1. **Wiki**
   - Description: Design of a Wikipedia-like online encyclopedia that anyone can edit. When entering the page we can see the options bar on the left. "Search Encyclopedia" to filter the names of the Entry-pages, and if you do not find what you are looking for, the option to load it. "Home" to return to the index page where we see the complete list of Entry-pages. To edit, we have to enter the one we want and there we will see the "Edit" option. "Create New Page" will allow us to load a new Entry-page. And finally, "Random Page" to randomly open one of these.

2. **Auction**
   - Description: Design of an eBay-like e-commerce auction site that allows users to post auction listings, bid on listings, comment on those listings, and add listings to a "watch list". Technologies used for this project Python/Django, JS/React, CSS/SASS.

3. **Mail**
   - Description: Design of the front-end and back-end for an internal email client that makes API calls. Once you're signed in, you should see yourself taken to the Inbox page of the mail client, though this page is mostly blank (for now). Click the buttons to navigate to your Sent and Archived mailboxes, and notice how those, too, are currently blank. Click the “Compose” button, and you'll be taken to a form that will let you compose a new email. Each time you click a button, though, you're not being taken to a new route or making a new web request: instead, this entire application is just a single page, with JavaScript used to control the user interface.

4. **Network**
   - Description: Design of a Twitter-like social network website for making posts and following users. Once you're signed in, you should see all the posts in the main page. At the bottom we have the menu bar with the five options (Home, Search, Following, Liked and Profile). Over the menu bar, floating to the right of the page is the button to create posts. You can give a like to the post you want, as well as follow the users you prefer, and so you will have these posts on the Like and Following pages respectively. You are also enabled to edit your posts and your profile data. You can select an image for your user, but in case you don't want to, the first letter of your username will represent your posts, with a random color to distinguish it from other users with the same first letter.
